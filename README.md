### ðŸ’»My second portfolio

Powered by React and Tailwind CSS
Hello! This is my second portfolio, developed with React and Tailwind CSS. This project was created with the aim of showing my skills in web development, using modern and updated technologies.


#### Technologies used

- React.
- Tailwind CSS.

### Project Organization

#### The project was divided into five main parts:

-About: In this section, I present a little about myself and my skills.

-Home: Here is the home page of the site, with a modern and pleasant design.

-Navbar: The site's top navigation bar, which makes navigation easy and intuitive.

-Skills: I present my skills in different technologies.

### Styling with Tailwind CSS
 This project was styled using Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable and efficient style library. Tailwind's flexibility allowed me to quickly style components, making the development process more streamlined and consistent.
 
 ### Responsive design
 This website is designed to be responsive on all devices, from smartphones to desktops. I created different layouts and styling rules to make sure the site adapts perfectly to each screen size.
